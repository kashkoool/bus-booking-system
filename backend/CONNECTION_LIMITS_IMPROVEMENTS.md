# Connection Limits Improvements

## Problem Solved
The system was experiencing excessive logging due to repeated connection attempts from the same user, causing log spam and performance issues.

## Improvements Made

### 1. Reduced Connection Limits
- **Before**: 5 concurrent connections per user
- **After**: 3 concurrent connections per user
- **Reason**: Prevents excessive browser tabs and reduces server load

### 2. Rate Limiting
- **Max Connection Attempts**: 3 attempts per 10-second window
- **Block Duration**: 5 minutes for excessive attempts
- **Benefit**: Prevents rapid-fire connection attempts

### 3. Smart Logging
- **Connection Attempt Tracking**: Tracks repeated attempts without logging each one
- **Reduced Log Spam**: Only logs every 5th repeated attempt
- **Connection Counter**: Shows total and active connections for better monitoring

### 4. Early Connection Validation
- **Before**: User connected first, then checked limits
- **After**: Check limits before allowing connection
- **Benefit**: Prevents unnecessary socket creation and reduces resource usage

### 5. Improved Block Management
- **Multiple Block Reasons**: 
  - `too_many_connections`: Too many browser tabs
  - `rate_limited`: Too many connection attempts
  - `blocked`: Already blocked user
- **Silent Blocks**: Some blocks don't emit events to reduce client-side noise

## Configuration Constants

```javascript
const MAX_CONCURRENT_CONNECTIONS = 3; // Max browser tabs
const MAX_CONNECTION_ATTEMPTS = 3; // Max attempts per window
const CONNECTION_ATTEMPT_WINDOW = 10 * 1000; // 10 seconds
const BOOKING_BLOCK_DURATION = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify improvements:

```bash
cd backend
node scripts/testConnectionLimits.js
```

## Expected Behavior

1. **Normal Usage**: Users can open up to 3 browser tabs
2. **Excessive Tabs**: 4th tab gets blocked for 5 minutes
3. **Rapid Connections**: More than 3 attempts in 10 seconds gets blocked
4. **Reduced Logging**: Only important events are logged, spam is eliminated

## Benefits

- ✅ **Reduced Log Spam**: No more excessive connection logs
- ✅ **Better Performance**: Fewer unnecessary socket connections
- ✅ **Improved Security**: Rate limiting prevents abuse
- ✅ **Better UX**: Clear error messages for users
- ✅ **Resource Efficiency**: Early validation saves server resources

## Monitoring

The system now provides:
- Total connection count
- Active connection count
- Blocked users tracking
- Connection attempt tracking

This makes it easier to monitor system health and identify potential issues.
